# Prism-Teasers
Teaser 2 : When adding a new property in PRISM GUI, the user inputs a text in a text field. For user’s convenience, there are also several buttons which the user can click and which generate a template text. These include, for example, “true”, “false”, or “Until”. Add another button for the formula “always” (see manual for the syntax) 
Teaser 3 :
Add a new icon into the toolbar (the part of the GUI which currently contains icons such as “Undo”, “Redo” … “Select all”. Clicking on the new icon should open a web browser and in it the PRISM manual. As an extension of this, you can implement the functionality in a way that the specific documentation page opened depends on the tab that the user is currently viewing (Model/Properties), and goes to an appropriate section of the manual, with the icon being disabled under Simulator and Log.
